# firebox

Run firefox in docker container!

## Install

At first, you have to install docker. And $USER must be in a docker group.

> $ git clone <https://github.com/Ch1keen/firebox>  
> $ cd firebox  
> $ ./install.sh firefox

Install would take some times, so I recommend you that take some tea or coffee.

When installation finished,

> $ firebox start
